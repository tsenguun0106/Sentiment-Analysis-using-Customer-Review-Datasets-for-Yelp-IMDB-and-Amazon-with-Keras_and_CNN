Sentiment Analysis using Customer Review Datasets for Yelp, IMDB, and Amazon with Keras_Tsenguun_Enkhbaatar

In this analysis, I conduct Sensitive Analysis using Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB datsets. 
Using Keras, we can see that the Deep Learning model, with Embedding layer, Convolution layer, Global Max Pooling layer, and one Dense layer, can provide good result. 

Another way to conduct Sensitive Analysis using the Deep Learning model is to use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with Embedding layer.

Also, we can see that the simple Logistic Regression actually can generate a quite good result.
